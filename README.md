    This is the home of the pipeline, weave. Its long-term goals: to provide accurate quantification, taxonomic classification, and functional profiling of assembled (bacteria and archaea) metagenomes!

## Overview
Welcome to weave's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the [weave](https://github.com/OpenOmics/weave/). 

The **`./weave`** pipeline is composed of two sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions:

    Run the weave pipeline with your input files.

    Downloads the reference files for the pipeline to a selected directory.

**weave** is a two-pronged pipeline; the first prong detects and uses the appropriate illumnia software to demultiplex the ensemble collection of reads into their individual samples and converts the sequencing information into the FASTQ file format. From there out the second prong is a distrubted parallele step that uses a variety of commonly accepting nextgen sequencing tools to report, visualize, and calculate the quality of the reads after sequencing. **weave** makes uses of the ubiquitous containerization software (singularity)[https://sylabs.io/]<sup>2</sup> for modularity, and the robust pipelining DSL [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/)<sup>3</sup>

**weave** common use is to gauge the qualtiy of reads for potential downstream analysis. Since bioinformatic analysis requires robust and accurate data to draw scientific conclusions, this helps save time and resources when it comes to analyzing the volumous amount of sequencing data that is collected routinely.

Several of the applications that **weave** uses to visualize and report quality metrics are:
- [Kraken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2)<sup>71</sup>, kmer analysis
- [Kaiju](https://bioinformatics-centre.github.io/kaiju/)<sup>4</sup>, kmer analysis
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), fastq statistics
- [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)<sup>6</sup>, fastq adapter removal (trimming)
- [FastQ Screen](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/)<sup>5</sup>, taxonomic quantification
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)<sup>1</sup>, ensemble QC results
